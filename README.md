# Agenclave

[![ci](https://github.com/daveck11/BlackBox-Agenclave/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/daveck11/BlackBox-Agenclave/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Live demo:** <https://agenclave.onrender.com> (free instance: the first load can take
~30 s while it wakes). **Walkthrough:** [Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/38124557b68b4372ac44e7d3d5875210).

> A **verification-backed trust layer for multi-agent coding**. As agents outpace
> human review, the bottleneck stops being generating code and becomes trusting it.
> Agenclave answers one question with evidence: **which of N agent outputs do I
> trust?**

**Status:** ✅ triage classifier + ✅ trust-scored best-of-N harness, wrapped in an
account-backed web app: triage → gate → **route to the trusted models** → judge →
**verify each patch and rank by what passes**. One command to run it: **`make app`**.
All ML numbers below are from real runs.

  Logged-in users save issues + runs and revisit them in a per-user Workspace.
```

Providers are pluggable behind one `Agent` interface
(`src/agenclave/harness/interfaces.py`): a **direct** adapter (Claude/OpenAI) and a
**BlackBox Agents API** adapter, switchable by config. The project runs its own agents
*through* BlackBox and adds the trust layer on top.

## The trust layer

- **Trust-scored routing.** Each model has a per-category reliability learned from
  in-loop verification (`Beta(passed+1, failed+1)`). Routing draws a Thompson sample
  per model and dispatches only the top `route_k`, so an unreliable model is
  transparently dropped - and the UI shows which models were considered, which were
  picked, and why.
- **Verification decides the winner, not reputation.** Reliability only chooses *who
  competes*. The winner of a given task is decided fresh: apply each candidate patch,
  run the tests, tier it (`trusted` / `applies_but_fails` / `broken`), and rank by
  what passes. A historically weak model can still win a specific task on the merits,
  and the prior never becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- **No leakage.** Per-model reliability is fed **only** by in-loop verification and is
  kept strictly separate from any held-out grader. Two paths write it, and both run
  the task's own tests: `scripts/verified_run.py`, and a web run on one of the
  practice-bug fixtures (each candidate is applied in a sandbox and tested before the
  Chairman speaks). A free-text web run has no repo checkout, so it is judged by the
  Chairman alone and writes **nothing** to the store.

## The app

- **Triage + recommendations** - classify an issue and get deterministic, per-type
  next steps. Bugs surface a one-click **"Send to the code-fix agents →"**.
- **Code-fix** - the issue is routed to the trusted subset and dispatched (dry run by
  default; live spends credits). The routing decision, candidate patches, and the
  Chairman's pick are shown. A live run needs a logged-in user and all users share one
  cap per UTC day (`AGENCLAVE_LIVE_DAILY_CAP`, default 20, counted in the database);
  dry runs stay anonymous and free. Logged-in users can **save** a run (nothing
  auto-saves) and delete it later.
- **Accounts + Workspace** - register/log in (bcrypt + JWT); save issues and runs and
  revisit them per-user. The anonymous demo works without an account.
- **Distributable** - `make app` builds the React app and serves the whole product
  (UI + API) from a single `uvicorn` process on one origin.

## Quickstart

```bash
make setup     # venv + pinned deps (CPU-only torch)
make stage1    # data -> train -> eval  (writes results/classifier_metrics.json)

make app       # builds frontend/dist, serves everything on http://localhost:8000

# Develop with hot reload (two terminals):
make serve     # FastAPI on :8000
make demo      # Vite dev server on :5173 (proxies to :8000)

make test      # pytest
make trust     # verified best-of-N -> per-model reliability (dry run by default)
```

Accounts/persistence need no setup - SQLite is created on first start
(`data/agenclave.db`). Set a real `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` for anything beyond local
use. Live runs need a provider key (`BLACKBOX_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
`OPENAI_API_KEY`) in `.env`, a logged-in user, and room under the daily cap
(`AGENCLAVE_LIVE_DAILY_CAP`, default 20). Deploy notes: [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md).

Windows without `make`: run the one-line equivalent per target (see the `Makefile`).

## Results

### Triage classifier (issue type, 4 classes, held-out test n = 1,793)
| Estimator        | Features      | Macro-F1  | Accuracy |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------- | -------- |
| **Logistic Reg.**| **TF-IDF**    | **0.675** | 0.674    |
| Random Forest    | TF-IDF        | 0.653     | 0.655    |
| Logistic Reg.    | MiniLM embed. | 0.628     | 0.628    |
| Random Forest    | MiniLM embed. | 0.569     | 0.578    |

> **Honest finding:** MiniLM embeddings did **not** beat TF-IDF on this task (lift
> **−0.047**). On short issue text a linear TF-IDF model is both stronger and lighter,
> so we serve it (torch-free + interpretable top tokens). Per-class metrics +
> confusion matrix: [`results/`](results/) and the [model card](models/MODEL_CARD.md).

### Trust-scored routing (small-n, labelled as such)
Per-model reliability is learned in-loop by the verified harness (`make trust`,
`scripts/verified_run.py`, and web runs on the practice-bug fixtures) and stored in
`results/model_reliability.json`. The current store, on the open-source fleet routed
through BlackBox (bug fixtures only):

| Model (via BlackBox)                 | Verified pass rate (bug fixtures) |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code`          | 17 / 17                           |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`           | 15 / 16                           |
| `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b`     | 14 / 15                           |
| `mistral/devstral-2`                 | 2 / 5                             |

These counts are **small-`n`** by design and move as more verified runs accumulate -
the point is the *mechanism* (verify → tier → rank → route), not a headline score.
The router draws from `Beta(passed+1, failed+1)` rather than crowning a leader off a
handful of points. Reliability is never seeded from any held-out grade (see "No
leakage" above). Offline demos with no network or API keys: `scripts/demo_router.py`
(Thompson routing) and `scripts/demo_trust.py` (verification-backed ranking).

## Datasets

See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for exact sources, licenses, and row counts.

> **Scope note (integrity):** the classifier ships an **issue-type** head only
> (`{bug, feature_request, documentation, question_other}`, NLBSE'23). Two
> intended-but-dropped labels are documented as deliberate omissions: **`performance`**
> (no gold labels exist in any citable source) and a **severity** head (no cleanly
> OSS-licensed, fetchable source was found). Nothing is fabricated to fill these gaps.
