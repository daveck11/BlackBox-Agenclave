# JSON store of how often each model's patch has passed verification, keyed
# by (model, category). trust_rank uses it as a tiebreak and the router
# samples from it.
#
# One rule matters here: the only thing allowed to write this store is our
# own in-loop verification (verify_patch). If a held-out grade like the
# SWE-bench harness ever fed it, the routing would be learning from the same
# signal we use to evaluate the system, and the numbers would be worthless.
