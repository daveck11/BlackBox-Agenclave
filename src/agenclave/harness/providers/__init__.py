# Provider adapters implementing the Agent interface.
#
# build_agents is the single switch point between the backends:
#
# - provider="direct"     -> one DirectAgent per model in agent_models
#   (Claude via Anthropic, GPT via OpenAI).
# - provider="blackbox" / "openrouter" -> one gateway agent per model, all
#   routed through that OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
#
# Everything downstream (dispatch, Chairman, eval) depends only on the Agent
# interface, never on which branch ran here.
