# The Chairman judge: scores candidate patches and selects/synthesises the best.
#
# Given a `Task` and the candidate `PatchResult` list from dispatch, the judge
# LLM returns a strict-JSON verdict: a best-first ranking of agent names, the
# selected agent, a written rationale, and (optionally) a synthesised patch that
# merges the strongest ideas. Output is constrained to a JSON schema via
# `complete_json` (forced tool use on Claude), so parsing never guesses.
#
# The judge model is configurable (`AGENCLAVE_CHAIRMAN_MODEL`, default
# `claude-opus-4-8`). It runs through the configured provider, exactly like the
# agents: provider="blackbox" sends the judge call through BlackBox's API too.
