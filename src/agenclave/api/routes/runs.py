# Pipeline + run persistence routes.
#
# `POST /runs` is the full pipeline: triage as the gate, then trust-scored routing
# and (when `live` is set) best-of-N dispatch + the Chairman judge. A dry run works
# anonymously; a live run spends credits, so it needs a logged-in user and counts
# toward one global cap per UTC day. Nothing auto-saves. Authenticated users keep a
# run with `POST /runs/save`; `GET /runs` / `GET /runs/{id}` / `DELETE /runs/{id}`
# manage a user's own saved runs.
