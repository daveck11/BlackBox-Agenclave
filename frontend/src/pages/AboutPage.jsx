        BLACKBOXAI Agenclave is a <strong>verification-backed trust layer for multi-agent coding</strong>. As AI
        agents outpace human review, the bottleneck stops being generating code and becomes trusting
        it. Agenclave answers one question with evidence: <strong>which of N agent outputs do I
        trust?</strong>

        Trust is earned from <strong>real verification</strong>. Per-model
        reliability is learned only from in-loop test runs and is kept strictly separate from any
        held-out grader. It also reports what did not work: transformer embeddings (MiniLM) lost to a
        plain TF-IDF classifier, so the simpler model ships.
